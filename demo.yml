AUDIO_SLICE:
  min_silence_length: 0.3  # The minimum length of silence at which a split may occur [seconds]. Defaults to 3 seconds.
  silence_threshold : 1e-4  # The energy level (between 0.0 and 1.0) below which the signal is regarded as silent.
  step_duration : 0.003   # The amount of time to step forward in the input file after calculating energy. Smaller value = slower, but more accurate silence detection. Larger value = faster, but might miss some split opportunities. Defaults to (min-silence-length / 10.).
